Hello and thank you for visiting my project repository! I'm Nisha, a data enthusiast with a passion for uncovering insights through data analysis. This project is a deep dive into the dataset from FitPro Gym, encompassing over 10,000 records of gym visits. Here, I apply SQL techniques to extract, analyze, and interpret data to help FitPro Gym better understand its client base and optimize its service offerings.
